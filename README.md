# Global-Black-Money-Analysis-Dashboard
This project analyzes global black money transactions using a 10,000-row dataset. Excel Power Query is used for ETL operations such as data cleaning, transformation, currency conversion, and risk scoring. Power BI is used to build an interactive dashboard that highlights transaction patterns, category-wise distributions, illegal fund flows, and country-level risk hotspots.

## 🔍 Problem Statement  
Black money movement across countries is hidden, unreported, and difficult to track. Financial analysts need a clear way to identify suspicious patterns, high-value transactions, and illegal fund sources. This project converts raw data into a clean and interpretable dashboard for investigative insights.

## 🎯 Objectives  
- Clean and transform raw transaction data  
- Convert USD to INR for better financial interpretation  
- Classify transactions by category, type, and legality  
- Generate a risk score for fraud or illegal patterns  
- Build a Power BI dashboard for visualization and insights
